# PROJECT GOAL:
* **Use President Trump's tweets (NLP and other features) to predict fluctuations in the stock market (using S&P 500 as index).**

    
### DATA USED:

* **All Donald Trump tweets from 12/01/2016 (pre-inaugaration day) to end of 08/23/2018**
    *          Extracted from http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/

* **Minute-resolution data for the S&P500 covering the same time period.**
    *         IVE S&P500 Index from - http://www.kibot.com/free_historical_data.aspx
    
    
* NOTE: Both sources required manual extraction, as both data types are difficult to obtain without paying $150-$2000 monthly developer memberships.
